# homebrew-iojs
A Homebrew formula for https://nodejs.org.

**NOTE**:  Work on the official homebrew `iojs` formula is ongoing. Follow [the progress here](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/pull/43725)!

## How do I install this formula?
`brew install hmalphettes/node/node`

## Documentation

Since there is an existing `node` formula in the offical homebrew repository, you have to reference the fully-qualified formula name when interacting with this formula.  e.g.
```
# If node was already installed:
brew remove --force node
brew install hmalphettes/node/node
```

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/tree/master/share/doc/homebrew#readme).
